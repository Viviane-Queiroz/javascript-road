    <h2>Document Object Model (DOM)</h2>
    <p>Dom is an interface that represents HTML and XLML documents through objects.</p>
    <p>With this interface native in browsers it is possible to manipulate the structure, style and content of those documents. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Some of DOM characteristics: </p>
    <br>
    <li> "window" is the global object present in DOM, so it's use is not mandatory</li>
    <li> An object inside DOM can have property and methods</li>
